        </blockquote>
        <figcaption>— Steen, 2007</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>For over a decade, research studies of mathematics education in high-performing
    countries have pointed to the conclusion that the mathematics curriculum in the
    United States must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to
    improve mathematics achievement in this country. To deliver on the promise of
    common standards, the standards must address the problem of a curriculum that
    is “a mile wide and an inch deep.” These Standards are a substantial answer to that
    challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is important to recognize that “fewer standards” are no substitute for focused
    standards. Achieving “fewer standards” would be easy to do by resorting to broad,
    general statements. Instead, these Standards aim for clarity and specificity.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assessing the coherence of a set of standards is more difficult than assessing
    their focus. William Schmidt and Richard Houang (2002) have said that content
    standards and curricula are coherent if they are:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        articulated over time as a sequence of topics and performances that are
        logical and reflect, where appropriate, the sequential or hierarchical nature
        of the disciplinary content from which the subject matter derives. That is,
        what and how students are taught should reflect not only the topics that fall
        within a certain academic discipline, but also the key ideas that determine
        how knowledge is organized and generated within that discipline. This implies 
        that to be coherent, a set of content standards must evolve from particulars
        (e.g., the meaning and operations of whole numbers, including simple math
        facts and routine computational procedures associated with whole numbers
        and fractions) to deeper structures inherent in the discipline. These deeper
        structures then serve as a means for connecting the particulars (such as an
        understanding of the rational number system and its properties). (emphasis
        added)
    </blockquote>
        
    
    <p>These Standards endeavor to follow such a design, not only by stressing conceptual
    understanding of key ideas, but also by continually returning to organizing
    principles such as place value or the properties of operations to structure those
    ideas.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In addition, the “sequence of topics and performances” that is outlined in a body of
    mathematics standards must also respect what is known about how students learn.
    As Confrey (2007) points out, developing “sequenced obstacles and challenges
    for students…absent the insights about meaning that derive from careful study of
    learning, would be unfortunate and unwise.” In recognition of this, the development
    of these Standards began with research-based learning progressions detailing
    what is known today about how students’ mathematical knowledge, skill, and
    understanding develop over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Understanding mathematics</h3>
    <p>
    These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in
    their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means
    asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does
    mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding
    is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student’s mathematical maturity,
    why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule
    comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a
    mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who
    can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule
    understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less
    familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and
    procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical
    tasks of sufficient richness.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Standards set grade-specific standards but do not define the intervention
    methods or materials necessary to support students who are well below or well
    above grade-level expectations. It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to
    define the full range of supports appropriate for English language learners and
    for students with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the
    opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to access the
    knowledge and skills necessary in their post-school lives. The Standards should
    be read as allowing for the widest possible range of students to participate fully
    from the outset, along with appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum
    participaton of students with special education needs. For example, for students
    with disabilities reading should allow for use of Braille, screen reader technology, or
    other assistive devices, while writing should include the use of a scribe, computer,
    or speech-to-text technology. In a similar vein, speaking and listening should be
    interpreted broadly to include sign language. No set of grade-specific standards
    can fully reflect the great variety in abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement
    levels of students in any given classroom. However, the Standards do provide clear
    signposts along the way to the goal of college and career readiness for all students.
    The Standards begin on page 6 with eight Standards for Mathematical Practice.
    </p>

    <h1>How to read the grade level standards</h1>

    <p><b class="highlight">Standards</b> define what students should understand and be able to do.
    </p>
    <p><b class="highlight">Clusters</b> are groups of related standards. Note that standards from different clusters
    may sometimes be closely related, because mathematics is a connected subject.
    </p>
    <p><b class="highlight">Domains</b> are larger groups of related standards. Standards from different domains
    may sometimes be closely related.
    </p>

    <h3><b class="highlight">Standards</b>Number and Operations in Base Ten 3.NBT<b class="highlight">Domains</b></h3>
    <b></b>Use place value understanding and properties of operations to
    perform multi-digit arithmetic.</b>

    between addition and subtraction.</li>
    <li>Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range
    10-90 (e.g., 9 × 80, 5 × 60) using strategies based on place value and
    properties of operations.</li><b class="highlight">Clusters</b>
    </ol>

    <p>
    These Standards do not dictate curriculum or teaching methods. For example, just
    because topic A appears before topic B in the standards for a given grade, it does
    not necessarily mean that topic A must be taught before topic B. A teacher might
    prefer to teach topic B before topic A, or might choose to highlight connections by
    teaching topic A and topic B at the same time. Or, a teacher might prefer to teach a
    topic of his or her own choosing that leads, as a byproduct, to students reaching the
    standards for topics A and B.
    </p>

    <p>
    What students can learn at any particular grade level depends upon what they
    have learned before. Ideally then, each standard in this document might have been
    phrased in the form, “Students who already know ... should next come to learn ....”
    But at present this approach is unrealistic—not least because existing education
    research cannot specify all such learning pathways.  Of necessity therefore,
    grade placements for specific topics have been made on the basis of state and
    international comparisons and the collective experience and collective professional
    judgment of educators, researchers and mathematicians. One promise of common
    state standards is that over time they will allow research on learning progressions
    to inform and improve the design of standards to a much greater extent than is
    possible today. Learning opportunities will continue to vary across schools and
    school systems, and educators should make every effort to meet the needs of
    individual students based on their current understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
    These Standards are not intended to be new names for old ways of doing business.
    They are a call to take the next step. It is time for states to work together to build
    on lessons learned from two decades of standards based reforms. It is time to
    recognize that standards are not just promises to our children, but promises we
    intend to keep.
    </p>

    <h1>Mathematics | Standards
    for Mathematical Practice</h1>

    <p>
    The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that
    mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students.
    These practices rest on important “processes and proficiencies” with longstanding
    importance in mathematics education. The first of these are the NCTM process
    standards of problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation,
    and connections. The second are the strands of mathematical proficiency specified
    in the National Research Council’s report Adding It Up: adaptive reasoning, strategic
    competence, conceptual understanding (comprehension of mathematical concepts,
    operations and relations), procedural fluency (skill in carrying out procedures
    flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately), and productive disposition
    (habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled
    with a belief in diligence and one’s own efficacy).
    </p>

    <h3>1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</h3>

    <p>
    Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning
    of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens,
    constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and
    meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into
    a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and
    simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They
    monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students
    might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or
    change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they
    need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between
    equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important
    features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger
    students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize
    and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to
    problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, “Does this
    make sense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex
    problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.
    </p>

    <h3>2 Reason abstractly and quantitatively. </h3>

    <p>
    Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships
    in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems
    involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract
    a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing
    symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to
    their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the
    manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved.
    Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of
    the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of
    quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different
    properties of operations and objects.
    </p>


    <h3>3 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</h3>
    
    <p>Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions,
    definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They
    make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the
    truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into
    cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions.
    communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason
    inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the
    context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able
    to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or
    reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain
    what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents
    such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense
    and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later
    grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.
    Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether
    they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.
    </p>

    <h3>4 Model with mathematics.</h3>
    <p>
    Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve
    problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might
    be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades,
    a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a
    problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a
    design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends
    on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are
    comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated
    situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify
    important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such
    tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze
    those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their
    mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results
    make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.
    </p>


    <h3>5 Use appropriate tools strategically.</h3>

    <p>
    Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a
    mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete
    models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system,
    a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are
    sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound
    decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the
    insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient
    high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a
    graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation
    and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know
    that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions,
    explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically
    proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external
    mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them
    to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and
    deepen their understanding of concepts.
    </p>

    <h3>6 Attend to precision.</h3>
    <p>Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They
    try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning.
    They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign
    consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure,
    and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They
    calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of
    precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students
    give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high
    school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.
    </p>

    <h3>7 Look for and make use of structure.</h3>
    <p>Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure.
    Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same
    amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes according
    to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see 7 × 8 equals the
    well remembered 7 × 5 + 7 × 3, in preparation for learning about the distributive
    property. In the expression x2 + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 × 7 and
    the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric
    figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems.
    They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see
    complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as
    being composed of several objects. For example, they can see 5 – 3(x – y)2 as 5
    minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot
    be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.

    <h3>8 Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.</h3>
    <p>Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look
    both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might
    notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over
    and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention
    to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line
    through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation
    (y – 2)/(x – 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding
    (x – 1)(x + 1), (x – 1)(x2 + x + 1), and (x – 1)(x3 + x2 + x + 1) might lead them to the
    general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem,
    mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while
    attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their
    intermediate results.

    <h3>Connecting the Standards for Mathematical Practice to the Standards for
    Mathematical Content</h3>
    <p>
    The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe ways in which developing student
    practitioners of the discipline of mathematics increasingly ought to engage with
    the subject matter as they grow in mathematical maturity and expertise throughout
    the elementary, middle and high school years. Designers of curricula, assessments,
    and professional development should all attend to the need to connect the
    mathematical practices to mathematical content in mathematics instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Standards for Mathematical Content are a balanced combination of procedure
    and understanding. Expectations that begin with the word “understand” are often
    especially good opportunities to connect the practices to the content. Students
    who lack understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too heavily. Without
    a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous
    problems, represent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the mathematics
    to practical situations, use technology mindfully to work with the mathematics,
    explain the mathematics accurately to other students, step back for an overview, or
    deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding
    effectively prevents a student from engaging in the mathematical practices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In this respect, those content standards which set an expectation of understanding
    are potential “points of intersection” between the Standards for Mathematical
    Content and the Standards for Mathematical Practice. These points of intersection
    are intended to be weighted toward central and generative concepts in the
    school mathematics curriculum that most merit the time, resources, innovative
    energies, and focus necessary to qualitatively improve the curriculum, instruction,
    assessment, professional development, and student achievement in mathematics.
